This project builds on my previous work on a java neural network. The previous network is used to implement a convolutional neural network from scratch as well.  

This is then tested on the MNIST and EMNNIST datasets through the DigitRecognizer class.

A max accuracy of 97.6% can be achieved with this implementation.
